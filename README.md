## From modifier

A modified version of [TKJElectronics/KalmanFilter](https://github.com/TKJElectronics/KalmanFilter)\
Tried to support c lang even though my c levels are pretty poor.

The functions' usage remains unchanged, but each call required that a pointer to a data structure be provided to them.

And, it is not used for the Arduino library.
